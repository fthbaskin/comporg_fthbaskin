Hello, I am a computer engineering student at Istanbul Technical University. This is a class repository in which the CPU I have designed for BLG 222E Computer Organization lecture using **verilog**.

## ITU Computer Engineering BLG 222E Computer Organization CPU project specs:
- Control logic and ALU
- 16 bit instructions
- Von Neumann Architecture
- 8 bit adressing (256 adresses)
- 8 bit word size (256 byte memory)
- 8 bit logic and integer operations using ALU
- 16 different types of instructions, excluding register selections
- Average 4 clocks per instruction
- Two bus systems
- A register file system consisting  of 4 data registers
- A register file system consisting of an adress register, a stack pointer and an instruction register.

There were two assignments given in this class. In the end my project resulted in working CPU capable of doing 8-bit operations. For specifics, check out pdf flies.
