Hello, I am a computer engineering student at Istanbul Technical University. This is a class repository in which the CPU I have designed using **verilog**.

## ITU Computer Engineering BLG 222E Computer Organization CPU project specs:
- Control logic and ALU
- 16 bit instructions
- 12 bit adressing
- 8 bit word size
- Two register file systems,
- Two bus systems

There were two assignments that resulted in working CPU capable of doing 8-bit operations. For specifics, check out pdf flies.
